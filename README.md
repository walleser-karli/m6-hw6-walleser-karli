I had many issues with this assignment, particularly adding/removing/toggling between hidden classes, working with the classList, and CSS specificity. I think I feel a little bit better after working it out with the professor, but I definitely need to practice some more.

I used the BootStrap documentation as well as W3schools to help with my styling and coding questions.
